## Dockerized Express App

I created this to show how to create a containerized node app that can be debuged with VS Code. I used make, but you can use docker-compose to start the service. 

## Instructions

1. Install Docker
2. Inside the root dir, run make run.
3. In VS Code selet the launch configuration and launch.
